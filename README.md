Designing an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using an 8086 emulator requires a systematic approach encompassing several key steps. First, one must gain a thorough understanding of the 8086 architecture, including its registers, instruction set, and memory organization. With this knowledge as a foundation, the ALU components, such as adders, shifters, and control logic, are designed to perform arithmetic and logical operations. Subsequently, the designed ALU is translated into assembly language code, ensuring compatibility with the 8086 emulator environment. Finally, rigorous testing is conducted within the emulator to validate the ALU's functionality and ensure proper operation under various conditions, completing the iterative design process.
